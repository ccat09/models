Obsidian 1000D 120 mm X 8 Radiator/fan tray measurements.


The long edge has a narrow ridge (0.39" wide)
 9.906 mm

The short edge has a broad ridge and is 0.88" wide or 0.866142 To be exact.
22.352 mm 

fan screw mounts ridges = 0.3 cm or 3 mm

green: 258 mm (short side) and blue is 540 mm (Length)

Fan opening 11.5 cm diameter = 115 mm


From the guy who gave me the measurements:

So the material is 0.05" thick. 
 recommend using 0.10" though.
 The material is folded once on the edge of the 120 mm holes. (so 0.10" thick there).
 The long edge is folded 90° and the remaining material is 0.39" broad.
 It is folded once for a smoother edge for just a bit (1 mm ).
 The short edge is folded 90° and is 0.88" broad. The grove is 0.08".
 You have to use the mounting mechanism from your 3 x 140 mm tray.
I'll send you the measurements of the screw holes in a bit

So he suggest printing the tray as 0.10 inches thick which is 2.54 mm instead of it's actual thickness of
0.05 inches or 1.27 mm for more structural integrity/stability.

This is 0.10" thick but as it's roughly double the width of the baseplate the baseplate is 0.05" thick
Here you can see that it's thicker than the baseplate.


The screw wholes for the mount to the sliding component are threaded and may have to be made manually unless a nut can fit the screw on somehow.
